= Configuration =

There are several options for how to change the output of the JSON:API rendering.

For a specific JSON:API configuration, you can create a Spring bean of type JsonApiConfiguration.
Currently, you can configure

* if the JSON:API version should be rendered automatically, the default is `false`.
* if JSON:API types should be rendered as pluralized or non pluralized class names.
** The default is pluralized.
* if JSON:API types should be rendered as lowercase or original class names.
** The default is lowercase.
* if page information of a PagedModel should be rendered automatically as JSON:API meta.
** The default is `true`.
* if a specific Java class should be rendered with a specific JSON:API type. This is useful when
representation model classes should get the JSON:API type of the domain model or when derived classes
should get the JSON:API type of the superclass. See the example below.
* if the above "Java class to JSON:API type" mapping should also be used for deserialization.
This is very useful for polymorphic use cases.
* if empty attributes should be serialized as an empty JSON object, like `"attributes": {}`.
** The default is `true`.
** If set to false, no "attributes" key is serialized if attributes are empty.
* A marker value that indicates that the JSON:API id should not be serialized. This is useful if you want to create JSON for a POST request. See also <<postWithNoId>>.
* A lambda expression to add additional configuration to the Jackson `ObjectMapper` used for serialization.

TIP: Since the JSON:API recommendation contains square brackets in the request parameter names,
make sure you provide the following configuration in your Spring `application.properties` when using Tomcat:
`server.tomcat.relaxed-query-chars= [,]`

Here is an example of how you would implement a JSON:API configuration:
