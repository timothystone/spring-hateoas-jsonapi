[[deserialization]]
== Deserialization

Simple JSON:API based JSON structures can be deserialized, but only the generic Spring HATEOAS representation
models are supported.

For example, a JSON structured like

[source, json]
include::{test-resources-dir}/movieEntityModelWithLinks.json[]

would be deserialized to an object of class `EntityModel<Movie>`,
where the `Movie` class looks like

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/Movie.java[tags=Movie]
----

Please be aware that the deserialization mechanism is currently not able to deserialize all types of
complex JSON:API structures that can be built with JSON:API model builder, but a few things can already be done:

* Deserialized meta
* Deserializing included resources into the relationship DTOs

For example, a JSON like

[source, json]
include::{test-resources-dir}/moviesPagedJsonApiModelWithIncluded.json[]

would be deserialized in a `CollectionModel<EntityModel<MovieWithDirectors>>`, so that all the names
of the directors are set on the Java side.

NOTE: `CollectionModel<MovieWithDirectors>` would NOT resolve the director names, because deserialization
of JSON:API specific things like relationships only works with Spring HATEOAS representation models.

More examples for deserialization of relationships you find in the section <<server-deserialization>>.

[[resttemplate]]
== RestTemplate

If you want to write a client that deserializes server responses into Java objects,
you can use RestTemplate, but with a little extra configuration.
The following example shows how such a configuration can look like:

[source,java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/RestTemplateIntegrationTest.java[tags=restTemplateConfig]
----

[[postWithNoId]]
=== Creating POST requests without serialized JSON:API id

If you want to use RestTemplate to do a POST request, often the JSON:API id will be created by the server
and is not part of the JSON body. The easiest way for doing this is to configure a marker value to indicate
that DTOs with this id value should not contain the JSON:API id in the resulting JSON.

For example, if you specify a configuration like
[source,java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/Jackson2JsonApiIntegrationTest.java[tags=noIdMarker]
----
and create a Movie DTO with this id, like
[source,java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/Jackson2JsonApiIntegrationTest.java[tags=noIdMovie]
----
the resulting JSON would look like
[source, json]
include::{test-resources-dir}/movieEntityModelWithoutId.json[]

[[traverson]]
== Traverson

The hypermedia type `application/vnd.api+json` is currently not usable with the `Traverson`
implementation provided through {spring-hateoas-url}[Spring HATEOAS].

[[link-discovery]]
== Link Discovery

When working with hypermedia-enabled representations, a common task is to find a link with a particular relation
type in it.
{spring-hateoas-url}[Spring HATEOAS] provides JsonPath-based implementations of the `LinkDiscoverer` interface
for the configured hypermedia types.
When using this library, an instance supporting this hypermedia type (`application/vnd.api+json`)
is exposed as a Spring bean.

Alternatively, you can set up and use an instance as follows
(`source` is the exact JSON you saw in the <<deserialization>> section):

[source,java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/JsonApiLinkDiscovererUnitTest.java[tags=link-discoverer]
----
